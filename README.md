**Donika Miller - Writing Samples (Download All: Miller-Writing-Samples.zip.)**

**INTRO** - These documents were originally published in searchable help sites that were designed, developed, and maintained using tools like MadCap Flare, Confluence, Oxygen, and VisualStudio. Accordingly, the content itself was developed in XML, HTML, or Markdown.

**USER WORKFLOW GUIDE (WorkflowGuide.pdf)** - This excerpt is from a user guide that serves doctors, nurses, office staff, and other medical professionals who engage with an Electronic Medical Records system intermittently, while doing hands-on work with patients. Information is distilled into bite-sized instructions and designed around descriptive headers so that it can be easy to find on-the-fly.

**USER INSTALLATION GUIDE (UserInstallGuide.pdf)** - Created for a technologically mixed audience, this guide describes the process for customizing the look, feel, and functionality of a webstore. The document is designed to straddle the line between technical/non-technical users in the same way the application itself does.
 
**DEVELOPER INSTALLATION GUIDE (DevInstall.pdf)** - An excerpt from a developer guide describing the installation of a java-based application with Apache Tomcat. The complete guide was part of the BOM for this product delivery, and came packaged with the installation files.

**RELEASE NOTES (ReleaseNotes.pdf)** - These notes were distributed far and wide to a general audience. My primary role in this project was building and writing the content for the online help that is linked (not really) in the first paragraph of this document.

**NOTE** - Please note that this content covers technologies that are either depreciated or publicly visible. Out of respect for the confidentiality of my employers and clients, additional examples are available only to known requestors.
