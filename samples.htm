        <h2>Writing Samples</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">These samples were developed in XML, HTML, or Markdown, using tools including MadCap Flare, Confluence, Oxygen, and VisualStudio. All were published in searchable online help sites, most of which I also built.</p>

    <p><a href="UserGuide.pdf" download="MillerUserGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">User Guide</a></p>
    <p>This information serves a fairly novice user base by using detailed definitions, parameters, and instructions. It is part of a complete application guide for a SaaS content and data management system, and covers a web utility that augments the primary application.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="WorkflowGuide.pdf" download="MillerWorkflowGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">Workflow Guide</a></p>
    <p>This excerpt serves doctors, nurses, office staff, and other medical professionals who engage with an Electronic Medical Records system intermittently, while doing hands-on work with patients. Information is distilled into bite-sized instructions and designed around descriptive headers so that it can be easy to find on-the-fly.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="InstallGuide.pdf" download="MillerInstallGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">User Installation Guide</a></p>
    <p>This guide is for a mixed user base, and describes the process for rebranding the look, feel, and functionality of a webstore. The document is designed to straddle the line between technical/non-technical users in the same way the application itself does.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="SOP.pdf" download="MillerSOP" style="color: #2A293E;">Standard Operating Procedures</a></p>
    <p>This business unit workflow document is built on top of the user guide information in the first writing sample here. It demonstrates single-sourcing through transclusion, where pieces of content are reused in multiple documents for consistency and quick updates across outputs.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="ReleaseNotes.pdf" download="MillerReleaseNotes" style="color: #2A293E;">Release Notes</a></p>
    <p>An example of release notes for your consideration. Distributed far and wide to a general audience.</p>
