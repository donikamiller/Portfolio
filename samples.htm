    <p>This information serves a novice user base by using detailed definitions, parameters, and instructions. It is part of a complete application guide for a SaaS content and data management system, and covers a web utility that augments the primary application.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="WorkflowGuide.pdf" download="MillerWorkflowGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">Workflow Guide</a></p>
    <p>This excerpt serves doctors, nurses, office staff, and other medical professionals who engage with an Electronic Medical Records system intermittently, while doing hands-on work with patients. Information is distilled into bite-sized instructions and designed around descriptive headers so that it can be easy to find on-the-fly.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="InstallGuide.pdf" download="MillerInstallGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">User Installation Guide</a></p>
    <p>This guide is for a mixed user base, and describes the process for rebranding the look, feel, and functionality of a webstore. The document is designed to straddle the line between technical/non-technical users in the same way the application itself does.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="SOP.pdf" download="MillerSOP" style="color: #2A293E;">Standard Operating Procedures</a></p>
    <p>This team=specific procedural document includes content from the user guide excerpted on this page. The content is a combination of audience-specific processes, and included or linked content from the primary user guide. This facilitiates rapid development of custom instructions for specific business units, as well as consistency and quick updates across outputs.</p>

    <p><a href="ReleaseNotes.pdf" download="MillerReleaseNotes" style="color: #2A293E;">Release Notes</a></p>
    <p>An example of release notes for your consideration. My primary role in this project was building and writing the content for the online help linked in the first paragraph of these notes. Distributed far and wide to a general audience.</p>
