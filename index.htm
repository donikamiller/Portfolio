        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="color: #ffffff;">These samples were developed in XML, HTML, or Markdown, using tools including MadCap Flare, Confluence, Oxygen, and VisualStudio. I also built the searchable help sites where these samples were originally published.</p>

    <p><a href="WorkflowGuide.pdf" download="MillerWorkflowGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">Workflow Guide</a></p>
    <p>This excerpt serves doctors, nurses, office staff, and other medical professionals who engage with an Electronic Medical Records system intermittently, while doing hands-on work with patients. Information is distilled into bite-sized instructions and designed around descriptive headers so that it can be easy to find on-the-fly.</p>

    <p><a href="InstallGuide.pdf" download="MillerInstallGuide" style="color: #2A293E;">User Installation Guide</a></p>
    <p>This guide is for a mixed audience, and describes the process for customizing the look, feel, and functionality of a webstore. The document is designed to straddle the line between technical/non-technical users in the same way the application itself does.</p>

    <p><a href="ReleaseNotes.pdf" download="MillerReleaseNotes" style="color: #2A293E;">Release Notes</a></p>
    <p>An example of release notes for your consideration. My primary role in this project was building and writing the content for the online help linked in the first paragraph of these notes. Distributed far and wide to a general audience.</p>
